Bugs of an app:
as I really hadn't had enough time to work on a real time tracker,
failed to achieve two things I wanted before submitting an application.
1. For svg that points to Favorites would be visible or not, depending on localStorage content's quantity, without a refresh.
2. For button "Add to favorites" and "Favorite" status to be updated whenever there's any changes in localStorage.
